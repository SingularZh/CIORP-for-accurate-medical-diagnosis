# CIORP: Causal Inference Operation Risk Predictor for CABG Surgery

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Causal Inference Operation Risk Predictor (CIORP) for predicting postoperative complications in patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). The model utilizes a Structural Causal Model (SCM) combined with backdoor adjustment techniques to accurately identify and mitigate the impact of confounding factors, even with limited data.

## Methodology
The CIORP model integrates several advanced techniques:
- **Structural Causal Model (SCM)**: Maps causal relationships among preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors.
- **Backdoor Adjustment**: Removes non-causal paths, focusing on genuine causal relationships.
- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**: Processes preoperative patient data by constructing a graph of patient and disease nodes.
- **LSTM**: Extracts temporal features from operation-related data.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Separates causal from non-causal features using a multi-head attention mechanism.
- **Few-shot Learning**: Enhances model performance with limited data through pre-training and fine-tuning.
